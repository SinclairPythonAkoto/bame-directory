### BAME!
### The Business Alliance for Minority Empowerment directory

This web app is a small app built using Python, Flask & Firebase to create a directory
for BAME (Black Asian & Minority Ethnic) communities - for London, the UK and eventually
the rest of the globe!

This was born out of the London BLM movement, following weeks of protests after
George Floyd was killed in America by a police officer who knelt on his neck for over minutes.

Since then people have had enough and have been calling out institutional racism both in
America and the UK, not only in the police departments but in all areas of our lives.

Although the fight for equality is far from over, there has been a wave of suggestions
of reforms and changes in which would increase equality amongst our communities.

This is where BAME comes in! We believe in promoting businesses within the BAME
community no matter how big the company is.
